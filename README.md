# SDC (SMT Dafny Compiler)

SDC compiles an SMT formula into a Dafny program. The synthesized program can then be verified to reveal bugs in Dafny.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Build the required Docker images.
./ci/build-images.sh

# For development or use, start a tmp container. 
# The local repository's folder is shared with the container.
./ci/tmp-container.sh

## The following commands are executed in the container.

# Build SDC so it is available for the integration tests.
./ci/publish-self-contained.sh

# Run the integration tests.
# The files generated by the tests are available in integration-tests/output.
lit ./integration-tests -vvv
```

## Code Style Before Pushing

Before pushing, ensure that the code is formatted correctly; otherwise, the CI will fail.

```bash
dotnet format ./src/SMTDafnyCompiler.sln
```

## Usage

```bash
TODO: For now check the integration tests
```
